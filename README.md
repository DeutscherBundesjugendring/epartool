# ePartool

The tool is written with multi-project support. It means that one database can be used by several projects running as separate instances. Some entities such as consultations and articles can be shared, others are project specific.

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

* PHP 7.3 or higher
* PHP extensions:
    * GD
    * mbstring
    * pdo_mysql
* MySQL 5.6 database with `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` encoding
* memory_limit: 256M


## Installation

âš  If there is a problem loading assets such as JS and CSS files, it is likely caused by error in the `application/configs/config.local.ini` in the directive `resources.frontController.baseUrl`. If app is running in subfolder, it should be set to `/subdir-name` otherwise leave it as `/`.

### Wizard
The preferred installation method is using the bundled installation wizard.

1. Obtain the installation package by download or create it by running the `$ robo create:install-zip` command in the root folder of the cloned repository where the `RoboFile.php` is located. 
2. Visit site in browser. If the application is not installed, the installation wizard starts automatically.
3. Unless this is a development build remove the `install` directory. This is not necessary if the app is to be accessed on domain matching `http[s]://devel.*` (see [Development](#development)).

### No Wizard
#### Filesystem
The tool uses the [Robo](http://robo.li) task runner to perform the build. It is invoked by running the `$ robo build` command in the root folder where the `RoboFile.php` is located. The following tools are needed:

* [Robo](http://robo.li)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* [Node.js + npm](http://nodejs.org)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)

Once the application has been built, several environment-specific settings have to be configured.

* Create the environment specific configuration files.
    * `application/configs/config.local.ini`
    * `application/configs/phinx.local.yml`
* You can use files `application/configs/config.local-example.ini` and `application/configs/phinx.local-example.yml` as a template and edit the values.

* Optionally set the `APPLICATION_ENV` in `index.php` to `development`.
* Folder permissions:
    * read: `/`
    * read+write: `/runtime/logs/`
    * read+write: `/runtime/sessions/`
    * read+write: `/runtime/cache/`
    * read+write: `/www/media/consultations/`
    * read+write: `/www/media/folders/`
    * read+write: `/www/image_cache/`
* Unless this is a development build remove the `install` directory. This is not necessary if the app is to be accessed on domain matching `http[s]://devel.*` (see [Development](#development)).

#### Build

1. Install PHP dependencies
    ```
    composer install
    ```
2. Install JS dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Install JS dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
 5. Build assets
    ```
    grunt
    ```

#### Database
1. Create database (see [Requirements](#requirements))
2. Run the following SQL files and commands in the specified order:
    1. Populate database
        ```
        mysql -u <db_user> -h <db_host> -p <db_name> < data/create-installation.sql
        ```
    2. Run database migrations
        ```
        $ vendor/bin/robo phinx:migrate production
       ```
    3. Create project. This step can be run multiple times to create multiple projects.
        ```
        mysql -u <db_user> -h <db_host> -p <db_name> <  data/create-project.sql
       ```
       Ensure the var `@project_code` in the SQL script is set to whatever is specified in the setting `project` in `application/configs/config.local.ini`.
3. Optionally run the following SQL files:
    * Create sample data
        ```
        data/create-sample-data.sql
        ```
    * Create admin user:
        ```
        data/create-admin.sql
       ```
        Due to security reasons the `create-admin.sql` script creates an admin with no password. Password can be reset using the forgotten password feature of the application itself or the file can be manually tweaked to insert the correct password hash directly.

### After Install Tasks
Regardless of the installation method, the following tasks must be done:

* Set up cronjobs. There are three ways to do it:
    - Configure an hourly cronjob to run the script `application/cli.php cron` via CLI.
    - Configure an hourly cronjob to send a GET request to the page `/cron/execute/key/<secret_cron_key>`. `<secret_cron_key>` is defined in `cron.key` entry in`application/config/config.local.ini` and is used to prevent unauthorized users from triggering the task.
    - In case it is not possible to setup cronjobs on your server, the fallback cron system will be activated by leaving the `cron.key` entry in `application/config/config.local.ini` setting empty. This means that cronjobs might be run with some probability on every request to the site. This feature is disabled in development mode.

* Copy the file `VERSION-example.txt` to `VERSION.txt` and optionally update the new file. The content is used to inform the users of which version of the tool they are using.


## Upgrading

### Wizard
Before you start updating your project, it is recommended to shut it down and display to users the error page with HTTP status 503 (Temporarily unavailable).

**Check if there is the table named `phinxlog` in your database. If not, your version is not probably compatible with update**

#### Using FTP and Browser
1. Obtain the update package by download or create it by running the `$ robo create:update-zip` command in the root folder of the cloned repository where the `RoboFile.php` is located.
2. Backup the filesystem and the database. Download all content of your project via your favorite FTP client to a temporary directory on your local machine and make an export of your database with phpmyadmin, adminer or other favorite webtool.
3. Update project files. Remove all files from destination directory, where the project runs. Then copy all files from extracted update package directory (dbjr-tool-update_v#.#.#) to the prepared destination folder. Don't forget to copy hidden files with name starting with "." in the update package folder if there are any. Finally restore your local configuration from previously made backup by copying:
    * `application/configs/config.local.ini`
    * `application/configs/phinx.local.yml`
    * media directory in `www/media`
    * logs directory in `runtime/logs`
    * `.htaccess` file in the root of the project
    * `.htaccess` file in the `www` directory
4. Create writable directories in the `runtime` directory:
    * `cache`
    * `sessions`
5. Comment out line with die() in `www/runMigrations.php` script to allow run DB migrations. You can edit this script in your FTP client or locally and then upload it if your client does not provide this functionality.
6. Run DB migrations by visiting the site `/www/runMigrations.php` in the browser. Be aware of result of this operation displayed in the browser. In case the execution time limit in PHP is reached and phinx migration manager could not complete all migrations, the project may stop working. Please try to execute migrations again to complete the rest of them and pay attention to what phinx migration manager returns in its output to the browser.
7. Uncomment line with `die()` to prevent running DB migrations script.

#### Using SSH and BASH
1. Obtain the update package by download.
2. Backup the filesystem and the database.
    * `$ cp -R project_dir backup_dir`
    * `$ mysqldump -h 127.0.0.1 database_name > backup_dir/db_dump.sql`
3. Update project files. Remove all files from project directory. Then copy all files from extracted update package directory to the project directory. Don't forget to copy hidden files with name starting with `.` in the update package folder. `$ mv tool-update/* project_dir/`
4. Restore configuration, media, logs and .htaccess from backup
    * `$ cp backup_dir/application/configs/phinx.local.yml project_dir/application/configs`
    * `$ cp backup_dir/application/configs/config.local.ini project_dir/application/configs`
    * `$ cp -R backup_dir/www/media project_dir/www/media`
    * `$ cp backup_dir/.htaccess project_dir`
    * `$ cp backup_dir/www/.htaccess project_dir/www`
    * `$ cp backup_dir/runtime/logs project_dir/runtime`
5. Create writable directories in the `runtime` directory:
    * `$ mkdir -m 755 runtime/cache`
    * `$ mkdir -m 755 runtime/sessions`
6. Run DB migrations by running `$ vendor/bin/phinx migrate -c application/configs/phinx.local.yml -e production`


### No Wizard
Upgrading the tool version consists of the following steps:
1. Updating the project files
2. Building the application using `$ robo build`
3. Running `$ robo phinx:migrate production` to apply database patches

## Development

The recommended way to develop the tool is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). The application in development mode is served at `http://devel.localhost`. First run of Docker can take a few minutes.

To build the documentation locally follow: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/


### Linux
The `docker-compose` tool is needed.

* `$ docker-compose up` to start server
* `$ docker-compose stop` to stop server
 
### Windows and MacOS
It is recommended to use `docker-compose-sync` for better performance.
Installation guide for specific operating system can be found on following websites:

* For Windows: https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/docker-sync-on-Windows
* For Mas OS: https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/docker-sync-on-Windows

`docker-compose` command is part of Docker and it is not required to install it again.

* `./docker-compose-sync.sh start` to start server
* `./docker-compose-sync.sh stop` to stop server

### GEO functionality
This functionality requires some third party components, which are included.

Interactive maps are provided by javascript library [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com). Map tiles source url is set in application config.ini in the section osm.data_server_url. This is the endpoint, where the JS library retrieves map tiles from.

Static maps images with marker for previews are rendered with built-in PHP service, which uses the same endpoint for retrieving and caching the map tiles.
 
There is no need to have any account or another kind of authorization to access map tiles on free servers. There are also no strict quotas for usage. For better insurance of availability it is possible to host OSM data on the own server or use some commercial solution.

If the application runs over secured connection (https), the geolocation service provided by a web browser API is used in JS library to locate users. In case the application runs over http, this functionality will be probably unavailable.
